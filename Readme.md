* So Initially I have used an <code>.ipynb</code> file to do the preprocessing and do some visualization

* Then I have made another Utilities Folder which contain <code>BusinessAnalysis.py</code> <code>CustomerAnalysis.py</code> to implement all the functions related to preprocessing and plotting

* I have imported the same file in <code>app.py</code> and used it along with streamlit to build the app.
